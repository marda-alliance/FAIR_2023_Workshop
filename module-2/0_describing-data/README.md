# Describing Data

Different types of data are best described by different types of formats.
For example, data which consist of many records that all share the same few attributes can be best described by tables whereas data with rich nested structure are best captured by "documents." 
These notebooks explain common tools available for capturing the structure of classes of data in ways both humans and software can understand.
